### Introduction

**Yikes, Yokai!** is a cute original shooter game inspired by Space Invaders and Japanese design and patterns. This game was built with vanilla Javascript and HTML Canvas (no additional libraries). 

### Game Story

"Yokai" are a class of supernatural monsters and spirits in Japanese folklore.

In old Japan, a small country village is plagued by nightly hauntings and possessions. Tonight, the village has called upon the famous exorcist monk, known for his light wielding abilities. Will he succeed and vanquish the yokai, or will the village continue to suffer under the cruel spirits? 

### Gameplay

Move the monk up and down in front of the village using the up and down arrow keys. Vanquish a yokai by shooting it with a beam of light by pressing the space bar. Every time you shoot a beam, your beam count decreases by 1. Every time a beam hits a yokai, the monk absorbs their spirit energy and your beam count increases by 1. Every level or 15 game minutes (approx. 15 seconds), you gain a beam boost. Use a beam boost by simultaneously pressing the left and right arrow keys to return your beam count to 6. If a yokai reaches the village, you lose. If the "hours left" reaches 0, you have survived the night and win!
